//! The estate's ESM/CAC contract, as types.
//!
//! The normative prose is `docs/architecture/CAC-KERNEL.adoc` (promoted out of
//! IDApTIK's `esm-contract-and-repo-boundaries.md`); this crate is its
//! executable expression. The prose stays normative — where the two disagree,
//! the prose wins and the crate has a bug.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! * **Versioning** ([`version`]): [`ContractVersion`], the compatibility
//!   rule, and profile references.
//! * **The data model** ([`belief`]): epistemic events, beliefs, provenance,
//!   the belief–plausibility interval and the interval-derived status policy
//!   (ADR-0016), and the affect/conation annotations whose *shapes* enforce
//!   ADR-0014's crossing rules — affect buys attention, never belief;
//!   conation publishes only its argmax.
//! * **The reduction contract** ([`reduce`]): CAC-KERNEL §2 as a trait, with
//!   a replay harness for the determinism MUST.
//! * **Package validation** ([`package`]): everything a package MUST declare
//!   and everything a loader MUST reject, as a validator that reports every
//!   fault.
//!
//! # What is refused
//!
//! * **No reduction implementation.** The working evidence ledger lives in
//!   IDApTIK until ADR-0017's extraction trigger fires.
//! * **No game vocabulary.** [`Proposition`] is opaque; the kernel never
//!   reads a game word (the same rule as `enaction_trace::Trope::kind`).
//! * **No proposition language.** CAC-KERNEL §8's hardest open problem stays
//!   open; settling it by accident in a type definition would be worse than
//!   not settling it.
//! * **No UMS dependency, ever.** The studio consumes this crate's field
//!   names and bounds as data; the engine must never import the studio
//!   (ADR-0013).
//!
//! The confidence type itself, [`Mass`], lives in `enaction-trace` — a trace
//! event may carry a confidence, and one authority for the type with no
//! dependency cycle beats a tidier-looking layering.
