//! A deliberately small, game-neutral event seam.
//!
//! The crate makes two structural commitments and is otherwise nothing but
//! their consequences.
//!
//! # Typed by domain
//!
//! Domains are separate types in the trace: affect never silently becomes
//! knowledge, a belief never silently becomes a goal, and none of them chooses
//! behaviour without an explicit selection event.
//!
//! # Particularised by trope
//!
//! A [`Trope`] is an *abstract particular* — **this** bearer's **this**
//! property-instance, with its own identity. Trope theory's claim (Williams,
//! Campbell) is that properties are particulars rather than universals: there
//! is no single shared "suspicion" that several guards each instantiate. There
//! are several suspicions, which *resemble* one another.
//!
//! That distinction is not decoration here — it changes what the engine can
//! say:
//!
//! * **Separate causal histories.** Two guards suspecting the same object are
//!   two particulars with independent pasts. Keyed as `(bearer, state)` pairs
//!   into a shared universal, that independence is representable only by
//!   convention; as tropes it is structural.
//! * **A belief can be referred to.** A trope has an id, so an event can point
//!   at *the belief that caused this*, not merely at an earlier event.
//! * **Resemblance replaces identity.** [`Trope::resembles`] asks whether two
//!   particulars are of a kind, rather than testing equality — which is what
//!   [`Domain::SocialRelational`] needs in order to have anything to reason
//!   over.
//! * **Domain becomes structural.** `domain` lives on the trope, not on the
//!   event, so one property-instance cannot have one event call it affective
//!   and the next call it epistemic. Domain consistency stops being something
//!   a validator has to hope for.
//!
//! # Other minds are modelled, not shared
//!
//! [`Trope::holders`] carries an *ascription path*: whose model this
//! particular lives inside. Empty is ground truth; `["billy"]` is Billy's
//! model of someone's state; `["billy", "anya"]` is Billy's model of Anya's
//! model. Because it is a path and not a reference, an agent can model a
//! state that does not exist — which is what being wrong about someone is,
//! and the reason [`Trace::divergence`] and [`Trace::projections`] can
//! measure it.
//!
//! # What the engine does *not* supply
//!
//! A game supplies the vocabulary in [`Trope::kind`] and [`Trope::about`]; the
//! engine supplies identity, ordering, causality and domain separation. The
//! engine never interprets a game word.
//!
//! Magnitudes are integer milliunits ([`TraceEvent::value_milli`]), never
//! floats: a trace must compare bit-for-bit across machines and replays, and
//! float arithmetic near identity does not (see `enaction-time`'s `lerp`, which
//! meets the same constraint the same way).
