//! Interest and belief kinetics, extracted from the IDApTIK proving ground.
//!
//! Origin: `idaptik-core/src/scenario/actor/belief.rs` — the arithmetic behind
//! an actor's object theory, already factored out of one guard's behaviour so
//! every archetype shared it. That double service (one game, many archetypes)
//! is what qualified it for extraction under ADR-0017; this module is the
//! third home, and the semantics are preserved **bit for bit** (see the parity
//! tests, which pin IDApTIK's committed constants).
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Each tracked object holds an interest meter. While the bearer observes the
//! object, the meter climbs at a per-channel rate, plus a carry bonus when the
//! object is being carried in view. While unobserved it decays — unless the
//! object is *pinned* (exposed, thrown, known-carried), in which case the
//! bearer does not forget. Belief forms over whichever meter is highest once
//! it crosses a threshold; **earlier entries win ties**, so callers list
//! objects in a deterministic order.
//!
//! # What was generalised on the way out
//!
//! * **Channels are game vocabulary.** IDApTIK's `Leakage {Still, Moving,
//!   Sprinting}` was baked into the mechanism as an enum; here the caller
//!   resolves its channel to a rate — via [`ChannelTable`], which makes the
//!   rates inspectable data rather than code — and hands the mechanism a
//!   number. The engine never learns what a channel means.
//! * **The meter advances by any monotone accumulator.** The parameter the
//!   origin called `dt` was already just a scalar; it is named `advance` here
//!   and documented as such. IDApTIK advances by seconds; Chronicles of
//!   Slavia's design advances instruction memory by *steps walked* ("memory
//!   erodes with motion") — one mechanism, both uses, zero code difference.
//! * **The ceiling is data.** The origin clamped to `0..=100`; the bound is a
//!   [`Kinetics`] field (IDApTIK sets `100.0`).
//!
//! # What deliberately did not change
//!
//! The arithmetic: operand order, the `max`-then-`min` clamp, the strict
//! inequality in the tie-break, the `>=` at the threshold. Determinism in the
//! host games is *replay-tested f64*; an "equivalent" formula that differs in
//! the last ulp is a different formula.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! Meters and beliefs map onto the trace as two tropes per (bearer, object)
//! pair: the meter is *salience* — [`Domain::Affective`] — and the formed
//! belief is [`Domain::Epistemic`], its events `caused_by` the meter events
//! that raised it. Appraisal precedes knowledge, structurally. Meter values
//! cross into the trace through [`to_milli`], the one explicit, documented
//! flattening (in the trope-particularity-workbench's sense) on this path.
//!
//! [`Domain::Affective`]: crate::Domain::Affective
