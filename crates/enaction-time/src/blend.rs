///
/// Both halves of this were established by measurement, and both matter:
///
/// * **The endpoints are clamped, not computed.** `prev + (curr - prev) * 1.0`
///   is not exact in general — `(-5.5, 3.3)` yields `3.3000000000000007` and
///   `(1e16, 1.0)` yields `0.0`.
/// * **The interior uses the one-term form.** The symmetric-looking
///   `prev * (1 - alpha) + curr * alpha` is worse: with `prev == curr == 42.0`
///   and `alpha = 0.1` it returns `42.00000000000001`, so a *stationary* value
///   shimmers in the last ulp every frame. The one-term form collapses to
///   `prev + 0.0 * alpha` and is exactly stationary.
///
/// A `NaN` alpha resolves to `curr`: it means something upstream is broken, and
/// the current step is the safe thing to draw. Propagating `NaN` into a
/// transform typically makes the subject vanish instead.
